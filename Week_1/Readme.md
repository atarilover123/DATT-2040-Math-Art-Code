## Homework 

Make a creative sketch (short program with a visual output) that is based around the grid structure we built in lab. 
Try not to spend longer than 45 minutes on the sketch, it’s interesting to improvise with your immediate ideas.

Think about elements such as grid spacing, the sizing of objects, the position, color and rotation of objects.

If you have lots of ideas you can try making multiple versions.







Experiment with if, else statements or <a href ="https://processing.org/reference/switch.html">switch</a> (a more convenient way of selecting between multiple statements). 

Be as creative as you like. If your final result looks radically different from a grid that’s OK. 

Comment your work as much as possible.  

Create a github repository for this course and add a folder titled Week 1 containing your submission and any other materials you would like to share. Copy the link into a word doc, submit to eclass as a word doc or PDF.

If you're feeling ambitious you can think about adding in elements such as <a href="https://processing.org/examples/recursion.html">recursion</a> to make a more complex, subdivided grid.
